## Learning objectives

After reading this guide, you should be able to:

- explain why command-line skills are useful in data science;
- distinguish a terminal, a shell, and Linux;
- explain what SSH provides;
- distinguish SSH access to GitHub from an SSH session on a remote server; and
- identify basic security practices for remote work.

---

## From a laptop to other computers

An analysis may begin on a laptop but later run somewhere else:

- in a Docker container;
- on a university server or computing cluster;
- on a cloud virtual machine; or
- as an automated task without a graphical desktop.

These systems are commonly controlled through text commands. A small vocabulary of Linux commands makes the same workflow usable across many systems, while SSH makes it possible to reach a remote system securely over a network.

---

## Linux, terminal, and shell are related but different

The terms are often used interchangeably, but they describe different things:

- **Linux** is an operating-system kernel and, informally, a family of operating systems built around it.
- A **terminal** is the window or application through which you enter text commands.
- A **shell** is the program that reads and runs those commands. Bash is a common shell and is the one used in this course's container examples.
- The **command line** is the text-based way of interacting with the shell.

A macOS terminal also provides a Unix-like command line. On Windows, students can use a terminal with tools such as Git Bash or Windows Subsystem for Linux, depending on the course setup.

---

## Why the command line matters in data science

### The same instructions can be repeated

A graphical action can be difficult to describe precisely: "click this button, select that file, and change this option." A command records the operation directly:

```bash
Rscript scripts/run-all.R
```

Commands can be copied into documentation or scripts, reviewed, and repeated. This supports reproducibility, although a command is reproducible only when its inputs, software environment, and assumptions are also documented.

---

### Small tools can be combined

Linux commands often do one focused task. Pipes connect them:

```bash
find scripts -type f | sort
```

Here, `find` produces a list and `sort` orders it. This composability is useful for inspecting files, filtering logs, and automating routine work.

---

### Remote systems often have no desktop

Servers and containers are commonly smaller and easier to automate when they do not run a graphical interface. The command line therefore becomes the shared interface between your laptop, a container, and a remote computing system.

---

### It helps you see the computing context

Commands such as `pwd`, `whoami`, and `hostname` answer three important questions:

```text
Where am I?    Which user am I?    Which computer am I using?
```

These questions prevent many mistakes when several terminals, containers, or remote servers are open at the same time.

---

## What SSH provides

SSH stands for **Secure Shell**. It is a protocol and a collection of tools for encrypted communication between computers. SSH can be used to:

- authenticate with a password or cryptographic key;
- open a command-line session on a remote server;
- run a command remotely;
- transfer files with tools such as `scp` or `sftp`; and
- carry Git traffic between a local repository and GitHub.

Encryption protects data in transit. Authentication establishes which account is connecting. Authorization still determines what that account is allowed to do.

---

## Two SSH uses in this course

### GitHub repository access

An SSH Git remote can look like:

```text
git@github.com:mmoessler/maize-yield-project.git
```

Git uses SSH to authenticate and exchange repository data. GitHub does **not** give you a general-purpose interactive shell on its servers. The account name in this URL is normally the literal `git`; GitHub identifies your personal account from the public key you registered.

---

### Remote computing

A server login commonly looks like:

```bash
ssh student@login.example.edu
```

After authentication, this opens a shell on another computer. Commands entered there run on that remote computer and use its files, software, memory, and CPU.
The hostname and username for a real course server must come from the instructor or system administrator.

---

## Public-key authentication

An SSH key pair contains:

- a **private key**, which remains secret on your computer; and
- a **public key**, which may be registered with GitHub or placed on a server.

The private key proves your identity. Never send it to another person, commit it to Git, or copy it into a course container. Protect it with a strong passphrase when practical.

On the first connection, SSH may ask whether you trust a host key. This key identifies the server, not you. Verify its fingerprint through an official,
independent source before accepting it. If SSH later warns that a host key changed, stop and contact the administrator rather than bypassing the warning.

---

## Command-line care

Text commands are exact and can change many files quickly. Before pressing Enter:

- confirm whether the prompt is local, inside a container, or on a remote server;
- use `pwd`, `hostname`, and `git status` to establish context;
- read unfamiliar commands and options instead of pasting them blindly;
- treat `sudo`, recursive deletion, and output redirection with particular care;
- do not expose passwords, tokens, private keys, or confidential data; and
- log out with `exit` when remote work is complete.

Linux expertise is not memorizing every command. It is understanding paths, permissions, input and output, and knowing how to consult `--help`, manual pages, and trustworthy documentation.

---

## How this connects to the maize yield project

The project combines these ideas:

```text
local computer
├── Git over SSH ───────────────► GitHub repository
├── Docker ─────────────────────► Linux container at /work
└── SSH login (when provided) ──► remote Linux server
```

The Git repository records the project. The Docker image supplies a controlled Linux and R environment. SSH can move Git data to GitHub or provide access to a larger remote computer. The same core command-line habits apply in each setting.

---

## Check your understanding

1. What is the difference between a terminal and a shell?
2. Why are text commands useful for reproducible work?
3. How does SSH use differ between GitHub and a remote computing server?
4. Which part of an SSH key pair may be shared?
5. What should you do before accepting an unfamiliar host fingerprint?
